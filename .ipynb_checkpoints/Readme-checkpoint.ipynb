    "### Background\n",
    "Due to multiple cyber attacks recently, many reddit posts which were 3 months and older were taken offline as their data were held hostage and copies were deleted. As the management team had decided to not give in to the demands of the hackers, the original data were not recovered. Luckily, the IT team has managed to recover the data partially with informations such as the title, selftext and other informations. Unfortunately, those data recovered did not have the subreddit name, url and links that would provide identifications to those posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Being a data scientist in Reddit, you made a suggestion to your manager that perhaps the subreddit name could be inferred/predicted from the remaining information recovered through modeling. As a proof of concept, you have been tasked by your manager to:\n",
    "- Use the latest 3 months of data, complete with subreddit name, from 2 random subreddits \n",
    "- Determine how accurate is the suggested approach in identifying the reddit posts\n",
    "    - Target goal is to achieve at least 90% accuracy\n",

    "#### What are the top words used in title for each subreddit?\n",
    "For LinusTechTips subreddit, words that are useful in identifying it are words at the top of the figure below. Examples are linus, pc, help, ltt, gpu and tech. Whereas for TrashTaste, those words that are commonly used in the subreddit are the words at the bottom of the figure. Examples are connor, garnt, chris, joey, trash and taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "For TrashTaste, those words that regularly appear are names or nicknames of the hosts or guests while for LinusTechTips, those words are more related to technology, pc and games related.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the top words used in selftext for each subreddit?\n",
    "In general selftext is more commonly used in LinusTechTips and the words used greatly help to differentiate LinusTechTips from TrashTaste as seen in the chart below where the value is significantly higher for LinusTechTips as comapared to TrashTaste. Some examples of terms that are more common and unique for LinusTechTips are 'pc', 'just', like', 'new', 'cpu' and 'gpu'.\n",

    "#### How does the numbers/types of ads differ between the 2 subreddits?\n",
    "Usually the content of the posts would affect the kind of ads shown on a website as no advertiser would like to associate themselves with a post that might be inappropriate. From the analysis, majority of posts from LinusTechTips are eligible for any ads as they are more family-friendly while TrashTaste, on the other hand, are only eligible for some ads. Both subreddits have some posts that are allowed to have NSFW (Not Suitable for Work) content.\n",

    "#### How does the link_flair_text differs between the 2 subreddits?\n",
    "Most posts for LinusTechTips has tags such as image, discussion, tech, post, video, question and wan. Whereas for TrashTaste, the common tags are meme, screeshot, clip, tweet and art.\n",

    "For the parameteric model, 4 different models were ran where 2 vectorizers and 2 estimators were paired with each other to determine which is the best combination. After using the title of reddit posts as the data, it is concluded that TF-IDF vectorizer with logistic regression has the highest accuracy score among the 4 models with balanced sensitivity and specificity score. Hence, this combination is selected to be used for modeling when more features are added.\n",

    "From the top 25 predictors for the model, it is observed that when the post's whitelist status is 'some_ads', the odds of the model classifying the post as 'TrashTaste' is ~10 times more likely while the having the word 'meme' in the selftext, title or link_flair_text would it ~2 times more likely for the post to be classified as 'TrashTaste' for each unit increase of those predictors assuming other predictors remain constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the other hand, words such as 'images', 'post', 'linus' and 'tech' tends to decrease the odds of classifying the post as 'TrashTaste'. For example, the word 'image' or 'post' would make ~0.4 and ~0.5 times likely for the post to be classified as 'TrashTaste'\n",

    "### 2nd Model - Random Forest\n",
    "For the random forest, 2 models were compared with each other, one with countvectorizer and another with TFIDF vectorizer. In general, the train CV and test score of both models are quite similar to each other when just using the 'title' as predictors. Hence, for apple to apple comparison with the parametric model, the model with TFIDF vectorizer is selected for enhancement.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "It is possible to use data from the subreddit posts to infer which subreddit they came from with high accuracy. While both models are usable in predicting which subreddit the posts came from, the 1st model (parametric model) is still preferred as compared to the 2nd model (random forest) due to its slightly higher accuracy. When using the 2 models to classify posts from late 2020, the accuracy is 99% for the 1st model and 98% for the 2nd model.\n",

    "### Potential Improvements\n",
    "As the reason this current production model is showing very high accuracy is due to the significant difference between the whitelist_status of the 2 subreddit chosen, when training model for other subreddits, we could:-\n",
    "- Include comments from each subreddit post\n",
    "- author_flair_richtext if the usage rate is high for other subreddits\n",
    "- Increasing the amount of dataset used for training\n",
    "- Checking if there are images in the post\n",
    "    - Certain subreddits tend to have more image in post\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Business Recommendations\n",
    "- Reddit could show a list of subreddits to the users which the posts would be suitable to be posted in\n",
    "- With the logisitic regression model, since there are coefficients that indicate what are the key terms for the subreddits, Reddit could list down the current trend or hot words in the subreddit"
